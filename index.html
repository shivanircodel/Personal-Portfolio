        <p class="desc">My name is Shivani Rajgopal (she/her) and I am currently a junior at the Ohio State University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In my high school, I took an Honors Design class at my school which has allowed me to explore different fields of engineering such as building a crane for civil engineering or creating a circuit box for electrical engineering. During my time here at college, I have taken several rigorous courses to be able to compete for internship opportunities. I am also well versed in several languages such as Python, Javascipt, and HTML and am always ready to learn more as I come across it. I am always working on projects regarding programming so if you ever want to collaborate and create a project together please contact me using the information on the Contact page.
